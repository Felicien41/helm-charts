# Kerberos Hub

Kerberos Hub is the single pane of glass for your Kerberos agents. It comes with a best of breed open source technology stack, modular and scale first mindset, and allows you to build and maintain an everless growing video surveillance and video analytics landscape.

## License

To use Kerberos Hub a license is required. This license will grant access the Kerberos Hub API, and allow to connect a number of cameras and Kerberos Vaults.

## Add helm repos

The Kerberos Hub installation makes use of this Helm chart. Therefore, we will add those repos to our Kubernetes cluster.

    helm repo add kerberos https://charts.kerberos.io
    helm repo update

## Prerequisites

Go and follow the Kerberos Hub installation at the [hub repository](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub). Once you have [installed all prerequisites](https://github.com/kerberos-io/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/hub#lets-give-it-a-try) come back here.

## Kerberos Hub 

So once you hit this step, you should have installed all required dependencies. Hopefully you didn't had too much pain with the certificates. Before starting, it's important to have a look at the `values.yaml` file. This includes the different parameters to configure the different deployments. Reach out to us if you would need any help with this.

Install the Kerberos Hub chart in a specific namespace and take into the values.yaml file.

    helm install hub kerberos/hub --values values.yaml -n kerberos-hub --create-namespace

Uninstall the Kerberos Hub chart

    helm uninstall hub -n kerberos-hub

### Post installation

After the installation you'll need to initialise the Mongodb with some objects. Have a look at the `mongodb/` folder, you'll find three files available:

- settings.nosql
- subscriptions.nosql
- users.nosql

Open your favourite Mongodb client (or cli) and connect to your Mongodb database as previously created (or have already installed). Import the previous mentioned `.nosql` files into a new database called `Kerberos`.

![Open the Mongodb client](assets/images/mongodb-client.png)

Once done you should be able to sign in with following credentials:

- username: youruser
- password: yourpassword

Please note that the default username and password can be changed [by the changing the related username and password hash](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub/blob/master/mongodb/users.nosql#L3-L5). The password hash is a bcrypt computed hash, which you can compute yourself [using a bcrypt client](https://bcrypt-generator.com/).

### Subscription settings

Once the collections are loaded in the Mongodb instance, you should see the `user`, `subscriptons` and `settings` collections. Those three collections will allow a user to login into the Kerberos Hub web interface, using the previously mentioned username and password. 

Next to that, in the `subscriptions` collection you will find a subscription for that specific user. The subscription specifies which kind of access the user has in terms of features and upload quota. 

Building further on those `subscriptions`, you will find a `settings` collection that contains the quota for each `subscription`.

### Indexing

Following indexes should be executed on the MongoDB database (Kerberos) to improve future performance.

    db.getCollection('sequences').createIndex({user_id:1, end:1, start: -1, devices: 1})

    db.getCollection('sequences').createIndex({user_id:1, end:1, start: 1, "images.instanceName": 1})
    
    db.getCollection('sequences').createIndex({user_id:1, "images.key":1})

    db.getCollection("notifications").createIndex({"user":1})

    db.getCollection("analysis").createIndex({"key":1})

# Upgrade

After installation, you might want to upgrade Kerberos Hub to the latest version, or change some settings. With Helm charts all settings are configured through the `values.yaml` file. After you made modifications to the `values.yaml` file, for example the version tag, or a new DNS name, you can run the `helm upgrade` command as following.

    helm upgrade hub kerberos/hub -f values.yaml -n kerberos-hub

The first argument is the helm project name, you could find this out by running `helm ls -n kerberos`. The following element is the helm chart name, and the last one is the `values.yaml` file with the new configuration.

# Building

    cd hub
    cat index.yaml
